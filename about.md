# Auto Nong
###### <cr> This mod is still in alpha and may not work as intended. </c>

The mod automagically finds and downloads NONG songs when entering a level.  

NONG stands for Not On NewGrounds and refers to any song that is not available on the original game. That means that to play it in-game, it needs to be downloaded externally and imported into the game. This mod aims to simplify that process.

Upon entering a level, a message will appear, offering the option to download the associated NONG song.

Furthermore, a new button will be integrated into levels featuring NONG songs. By clicking this button, a list of available NONG songs for the respective level will be displayed, allowing you to download them conveniently without leaving the game.


## Indexes
The mod knows which levels have NONG songs from "indexes".
You can add/remove indexes in the settings of the mod.

## Credits
Without these the mod wouldn't be possible.
