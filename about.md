# Auto Nong
###### <cr> This mod is still in alpha and may not work as intended. </c>

The mod automagically finds and downloads NONG songs when entering a level.  

NONG stands for Not On NewGrounds and refers to any song that is not available on the original game. That means that to play it in-game, it needs to be downloaded externally and imported into the game. This mod aims to simplify that process.

Upon entering a level, a message will appear, offering the option to download the associated NONG song.

Furthermore, a new button will be integrated into levels featuring NONG songs. By clicking this button, a list of available NONG songs for the respective level will be displayed, allowing you to download them conveniently without leaving the game.

## How to add Nongs to the mod
There are multiple ways to add Nongs to the mod and make them appear in game:
- Fill the form on GitHub [here](https://github.com/FlafyDev/auto-nong-indexes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=nong-addition%2Cofficial-addition&projects=&template=add-nong-song.yml&title=Add+Nong+Song%3A+).
- Or get the nong added to [SFH (SongFileHub)](https://songfilehub.com/).

## Indexes
The mod knows which levels have NONG songs from "indexes".
You can add/remove indexes in the settings of the mod.

## Credits
Without these the mod wouldn't be possible.

- [Geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode)
- [Jukebox](https://github.com/Fleeym/jukebox)  
  - This mod intergrates with Jukebox for swapping songs for levels.  
  - Additionally, Jukebox's code was helpful to figuring out how to make this mod.
- [SFH (SongFileHub)](https://songfilehub.com/) - Auto Nong gets information about many of its Nongs from SFH.
- SFH mirrors(like `sfh-rooot` and `sfh-pingusmc`) - Auto Nong downloads SFH Nongs from these mirrors.
